# displayStreamerC
A display streaming utility, for streaming a desktop to a USB attached display. 
I wrote this for the [EL display project](https://github.com/diminDDL/EL_driver).
It's a bit of a mess since it's just a prototytpe. More details can be found [here](https://dmytroengineering.com/content/projects/how-i-went-about-el-display).

To build, navigate to `Streamer` directory and run `make -B -j12 -o3`
